I'm Nicol√≤, a husband, software developer, vegetable grower, part time archer and vintage lens collector.

I spent a good chunk of my professional life by running a [cinema post production firm](https://www.magesticfilm.com/en/) up until 2018, where I had to deal on a daily basis with Digital Cinema Packages, Linux machines and a decent number of bash glue scripts to make things easier.

After that I re-embarked on the IT side by switching to a System Administrator role at an [italian Email Service Provider](https://cerberoos.com/), where I learnt about SQL and [sharded NoSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/) database management and I picked up [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) because I was too lazy to upgrade some 150 VMs to the new CentOS (RIP) version by hand.

Sysadmin by day, learner by night, I tried to get up to speed with the web development world of 2018: a world that I left when jQuery and Bootstrap were on the rise. After a quick foray in Javascript land (it was so shiny!) with Vue and Nuxt, I decided to lean more towards a more _boring_ ecosystem, such as Ruby and Rails.

This is how I landed where I am now: working for an [awesome company](https://nebulab.com) that values contributing to open source (official maintainers of [Solidus](https://solidus.io)), has a distributed workforce with an async-first work methodology and places [employee well being](https://www.bestworkplaces.it/aziende/nebulab/) very high on the priority list.
