    Hey 👋 I'm Nicolò
  </h2>

<div class="markdown mt-4" markdown="1">

I'm Nicolò, a husband, Software and Cyber Security consultant, vegetable grower, part time archer and vintage lens collector.

I'm currently working fully remote as a **Senior Software Engineer** and **Team Lead** for an [italian company](https://nebulab.com) in the eCommerce space where I deal with complex problems in designing and developing distributed and resilient systems, with high throughput, resiliency and security in mind. I do that employing an **Object Oriented Pogramming language** such as Ruby. Tech stacks I'm mostly working right now comprise Ruby, Rails, Stimulus, Heroku, AWS (Lambda, RDS, SQS and ECS).

In my spare time I like to grow my Cyber Security skills by participating in Bug Bounty programs.

I also run a **YouTube channel** (in Italian 🇮🇹) where I talk about **Cyber Security**, **Coding** (specifically Ruby), and **Artificial Intelligence**. My goal is to share what I learn and make technical concepts accessible. [Check out the channel]({{ site.youtube_url }}).

Past experiences include (recent to less recent):

- Consultancy work as a **DevOps Engineer** kicking off a Kubernetes environment and CI/CD pipeline for a Payment Processor. Tech stack was Java, Maven, Jenkins, SonarQube, Kubernetes, Docker and Oracle Cloud.
- **DevOps Engineer** at an Italian Email Service Provider, where I had to manage more than 150 Linux VMs providing [sharded NoSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/) database functionality with MongoDB and more than 4500 [Postfix](https://www.postfix.org/) Mail Transfer Agents. To deal with all that complexity I led an effort in the company to adopt [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and develop proper roles and playbooks to maintain the whole infrastructure, automating most of daily tasks. I distilled what I learnt there about email administration in a [short eBook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLMWMKQD).
- **Technical Co-Founder** and **Managing Partner** at a [cinema post production firm](https://www.magesticfilm.com/en/), where I acted as the translation layer between the technical and business sides of customers. During this time I dealt with lots of different video encoding formats, tuning encoders, mastering high-end images to DCI standards and gluing all together with custom scripts running on Linux machines.
